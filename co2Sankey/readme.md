This simply forks the [d3noob example](http://bl.ocks.org/d3noob/5028304) to allow a csv as the data source.  I am sure that this is probably the ugliest way to do it, but it does work.  Please let me know if you have any comments.

This is an example of a Sankey diagram made using d3.js and the sankey plugin. 

It has a point of differenc from other Sankey diagrams I have seen in that the nodes can be moved horizontally *and* vertically. 

A description of how it was put together and techniques for implimenting Sankey diagrams in general with d3.js can be found at [d3noob.org](http://www.d3noob.org/) or you can download the full text in the D3 Tips and Tricks book (for free) from [Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/D3-Tips-and-Tricks).
